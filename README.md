There are many small bricks used to build LEGO Mindstorms robots. If you canâ€™t see them in
the tray, it can take extra time to find them. The app should help the user locate the part they
need. Possible solutions include, using sound to help the user find the brick when the phone is
help above the tray or if they take a picture of the tray the phone gives the user the location (e.g.
upper right corner of the tray). Needs to be IOS or multiplatform. Some work was done on this
last year, including collecting a lot of LEGO data. It would be great to see tis project continue
forward.
